## Summary
Diary is a program that keeps an encrypted, password-protected database of text files.
It provides a CLI for interacting with its contents. Individual files can be edited with any text editor.
Whenever files are not actively being edited, they will be encrypted.

## Usage
To use Diary, run the CLI via the following command from the directory that contains the diary module:
`python -m diary.main [path]`
where path is an optional argument containing the database root directory,
using the current directory if not provided.

## Using the CLI
To use the CLI, the two main commands you should be aware of are "help" and "exit", which function as their name implies.
Apart from this, notably the intended use case of this program is to bring up a file specific to the current day, for which the command "today" is provided.

## Regarding text editors
Diary will by default launch text files in the system default text editor.
If this is an editor such as notepad++ which opens a new tab instead of a new session for each file, this program may not work properly.
It is necessary to either force the editor to use one tab per session in the editor's settings, or to close the editor between opening each file.

## Writing to Diary
Text files sent to Diary currently require a special format.
This format supports categories and subcategories, denoted by enclosure in square brackets '[]' and parentheses '()' respectively.
Categories are mandatory. Subcategories are optional.
Example:

```
[My Category]
I am writing about the subject of My Category without any particular subcategory.
(My Sub-category)
I am writing about this subcategory. In future, I will be able to find this particular text snippet by searching for both My Category and My Sub-category.
```
