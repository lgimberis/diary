# Summary
Diary is a program which facilitates daily diary-style updates to encourage introspection and track productivity.
It records all inputs into a single database file, which can later be accessed independently of this program.

Features:
 - A minimalistic (read: ugly) GUI
 - A to-do list, shown on startup
 - A calendar system, which presents reminders on the startup screen
 - Logging and timestamping of all entries
 - Category system for grouping entries by their purpose
 - Convenient searching of previous entries by time, category, or keywords
