[Purpose]
I need to keep track of what I do on a day-to-day basis.
This helps keep me motivated and also helps me understand the progress I've made in the past few months.

[Function]
Entry for each day is kept in a file with filename format YYYY_MM_DD.txt

The following entries are retained across days:
 - memo.txt, things I ought to remember on a long-term basis
 - todo.txt, day to day tasks I need to remember to do
 - portfolio.txt, a complete summary of my abilities and competencies, to be updated alongside each entry.
