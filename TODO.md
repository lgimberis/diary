Item 1) Allow alternative formats for text files. Handle these correctly.
 Write created text files with the chosen format. Save this to a config
   file of some sort, possibly in the root directory. Consider Item 2 during this process.
   
Item 2) Text file formats need to be considered. They must be user-friendly, intuitive, and customisable.
The best possible format is the one the user specifies. Perhaps we can imply the
format from the first text files fed to the program?

Item 3) Allow for an arbitrary number of levels of categories in all places.
Where necessary, Rebrand in the context of text files: keys to categories, 
and categories to subcategories.

Item 4) Metadata tracking. What convenience functions do we need? Make sure
diary is using this correctly.
